                    <P>At the age of 17 I graduated high school and began to manage a band full time. I also wrote all of the
                        songs for the band, and took up guitar and lead vocal duties. We managed to tour a few times and
                        secure two contracts from some indie labels. It was a ton of fun and gave me some valuable work and
                        life experience.</P>
                    <p>I also took several hours of private art classes a week all throughout middle school and high school
                        which turned into some amazing opportunities to teach painting at several restaurants around the
                        Orange County area for Wine and Paint nights.</p>
                    <p>In 2016, I started a comic book company named "Super Dope Comix" where I managed to write, pencil, ink,
                        and letter my first comicbook. We took the comic and some merchandise I had also created to a few
                        comic book conventions around Southern California and Nevada, it was an absolute blast and I learned
                        a ton about what it takes to take something from concept to completion.</p>
                    <p>In the spring of 2017 I began a new adventure, learning the fine art of computer programming. Learning
                        how to code has been, hands down, the most challenging thing I have ever done, and it has also proven
                        to be one of the most rewarding. I look forward to learning as much as I possibly can and I hope
                        to go far with these skills.</p>
